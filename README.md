# my-terraform-project
This Terraform project automates the deployment of a highly available infrastructure on AWS, designed to receive and distribute incoming traffic across two EC2 instances running in separate Availability Zones (AZs).  This setup ensures resilience against AZ failures, maximizing uptime.  The infrastructure likely includes a load balancer (like an Application Load Balancer or Classic Load Balancer) to distribute traffic efficiently and a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network management.  The project's automated nature simplifies deployment, updates, and teardown of the infrastructure.
